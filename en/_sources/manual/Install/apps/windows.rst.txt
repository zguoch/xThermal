Command line tool
---------------------

The standalone command line tool(cmd) is also included in the installer, 
if you want to use this cmd app, 
just need to add the command line tool install path (see :numref:`fig:install:windows`) to the system environment variable of :code:`PATH` (see :numref:`fig:install:windows:setENVpath`).
Then :code:`swEOS` command can be used in PowerShell or traditional cmd terminal.
