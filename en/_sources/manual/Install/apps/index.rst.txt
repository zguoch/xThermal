The pre-compiled applications include both desktop application with GUI (graphical user interface) 
and standalone command line tool (cmd) which can be used for batch calculation.

.. tip:: 

   The desktop app with GUI also contains cmd features, it works well in macOS and linux (ubuntu), 
   but there still are some issues in windows version.
   Therefore for the windows users, if you want to use cmd feature, please use the standalone cmd app.
