Build c++ library 
=====================

One can download the source code and save it to wherever you like, assuming save the source to :code:`Download` download folder.

2. How to do ?

      # 1. clone source code from github, or just download the source code and skip this step.
      git clone https://github.com/zguoch/saltwatereos.git

      # 2. check directory in to Library folder of the source code
      cd Library
      
      # 3. create a build folder
      mkdir build

      # 4. cmake without building other APIs
      cmake -DBuild_API_MultiLanguage=OFF ..
      
      # 5. build the lib: you will get libeosH2ONaCl.a in the build folder
      make 
      
      # 6. install the lib to ../lib path, so the ../lib path will be created and libeosH2ONaCl.a is copied in this path
      make install

      The |vs2017| have to be installed and the path of `MSBUILD.exe` is added in the system environment PATH variable. All the following steps are performed in PowerShell.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # 1. clone source code from github, or just download the source code and skip this step.
      git clone https://github.com/zguoch/saltwatereos.git

      # 2. check directory in to Library folder of the source code
      cd Library
      
      # 3. create a build folder
      mkdir build
      cd build
      
      # 4. cmake without building other APIs
      cmake -DBuild_API_MultiLanguage=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 ..

      # 5. build using msbuild.exe: then you will find eosH2ONaCl.lib is generated in the Release folder
      msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release eosH2ONaCl.vcxproj

      # 6. install (optional): the eosH2ONaCl.lib is copied to ../lib folder
      msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj

Build standalone command line tool
=======================================

.. important:: 

   If you want to compile the standalone command line tool by yourself, you have to finish the previous step of :ref:`build_lib` firstly!

Build APIs
=====================

.. warning:: 

   APIs of other programing language, e.g., python, tcl, js, depends on a lot of tools (e.g. swig, npm, python) and need a lot of programing skills. 
   We don't recommend users to try out this unless they master cross-platform and multi-language programing skills. But users can use the APIs for research, for example the python API :code:`pyswEOS` python users.

   Of course, users can find details in the source code if they are interested in that.

Build Desktop App with GUI 
================================

.. warning:: 

   Again, compilation of the desktop app with GUI also not that easy, because the GUI version is depends on Qt_ and VTK_.
   Therefore, it also needs a lot of programing skills to reach that.
   If users are interested in building the GUI version by themselves, please read the source code.
